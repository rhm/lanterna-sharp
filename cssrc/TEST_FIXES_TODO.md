# Lanterna-Sharp Test Fixes TODO List

## Current Status  
4 failing tests out of 86 total tests (ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR IMPROVEMENT from 12 failing out of 74)

## Completed Fixes âœ…
1. **TerminalSize.ToString()** - Fixed format to return "TerminalSize{columns=X, rows=Y}"
2. **TextCharacter.ToString()** - Fixed to return only the character
3. **TerminalPosition.ToString()** - Fixed format to return "TerminalPosition{column=X, row=Y}"
4. **Cursor Wrapping** - Fixed cursor wrapping at line edges (changed > to >= comparison)
5. **TextBuffer Double-Width Character Bug** - Fixed double-width character padding detection using reference equality instead of value equality, preventing space characters from being treated as padding
6. **ðŸš€ MAJOR: Screen Buffer Corruption Bug** - Fixed critical bug where writing to bottom-right terminal position (79,23) caused cursor wrapping and buffer trimming that corrupted previously written characters. Fixed by preventing cursor advancement when at the very last terminal position.

## Fixed Tests âœ…
- **CanRefreshScreenToTerminal** âœ…
- **CanTestScreenGraphics** âœ…  
- **CanCreateTerminalScreen** âœ…
- **CanWriteToScreenBuffer** âœ…
- **CanTestScreenCursor** âœ…
- **CanTestScreenResize** âœ…
- **CanTestCompleteDialogInterface** âœ…

## Remaining Issues (4 tests)

### 1. Graphics Operations (Medium Priority)
- **CanTestMultipleScreenOperations** - Graphics line drawing not working correctly

### 2. Dirty Cell Tracking (Medium Priority)  
- **CanTestPartialRefresh** - Dirty cell tracking not working in DefaultVirtualTerminal
- **Issue**: GetDirtyCells() returns empty set when it should track modified positions

### 3. Private Mode Cursor Position (Low Priority)
- **CanEnterAndExitPrivateMode** - Cursor position incorrect after exiting private mode
- **Issue**: Test expects cursor at [5:5] but it's at [6:5] (cursor advances after writing)
- **Note**: This might be a test expectation issue rather than implementation bug

### 4. Input Handling (Low Priority)
- **CanSimulateModifierKeys** - Modifier key simulation not working  
- **Issue**: KeyStroke implementation may not handle modifiers correctly

## Root Cause Analysis - COMPLETED âœ…

### Major Bug Fixed: Buffer Corruption During Screen Refresh
**Problem**: Writing to the bottom-right terminal position (79,23) triggered cursor wrapping and buffer trimming, which corrupted all previously written characters during screen refresh operations.

**Root Cause**: In `DefaultVirtualTerminal.PutCharacter()`, when writing to the last position:
1. Cursor advanced from (79,23) to (80,23) 
2. This triggered `MoveCursorToNextLine()` â†’ cursor became (0,24)
3. Row 24 >= terminal height (24), so `TrimBufferBacklog()` was called
4. Buffer trimming removed top lines and shifted all content, corrupting written characters

**Fix**: Modified cursor advancement logic to prevent wrapping when at the very last terminal position:
```csharp
bool isLastPosition = (_cursorPosition.Column == _terminalSize.Columns && 
                       _cursorPosition.Row == _terminalSize.Rows - 1);
if (_cursorPosition.Column >= _terminalSize.Columns && !isLastPosition)
{
    MoveCursorToNextLine();
}
else if (isLastPosition)
{
    // Stay at the last position instead of wrapping to avoid buffer corruption
    _cursorPosition = new TerminalPosition(_terminalSize.Columns - 1, _terminalSize.Rows - 1);
}
```

## Next Steps
The remaining 4 issues are smaller, isolated problems that don't affect the core functionality. The major screen rendering and buffer management issues have been resolved.
